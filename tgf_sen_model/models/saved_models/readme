This directory contains a bunch of models that I have saved for some reason or another. This file is an index/guide to these saved models

---------------------------
- I tried calibrating the model to the MCF7 and T47D data simultaneously
- All kinetic parameters are fixed
- All non-phospho or active species are estimated and duplicated for each experiment
- Estimated between boundaries of 0.1 and 10
- Fits are reasonable.
